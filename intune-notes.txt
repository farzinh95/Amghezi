Intune notes


Documentation link

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune


You must have the subscription go add your domain name in your account

Create a AD then install azure id / entra id connect and login with your credentials



AZURE ID IS NOW CALLED ENTRA ID
PORTAL.AZURE.COM IS NOW ADMIN.AZURE.COM

Add a devices to autopilot

you should add the hardware / device ID in intune so that it get recognised.


you can get device ID for autopilot script


Install-Script -Name -Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo

cd\

mkdir ID

Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -OutputFile c:\id\deviceid.csv

-----------------------
Now add the device in the panel

Devices / Enroll devices / Devices


import your csv file

========================================================

Creating a deployment profile

you want a deployment profile to do that you must have different groups to manage devices

in intune
First go to groups
create a new group

IT MUST BE A SECURITY GROUP because only security groups can have devicess in it


Give it group name like AutopilotManaged

Membership type Dynamic Device

go to Add a query

search this on google
autopilot dynamic security group

the microsoft article explain the whole thing but to make it easier I copy the stuff here too (the stuff between ###)

###
When creating expressions:

To create a group that includes all of the Autopilot devices, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -startsWith "[ZTDid]")).

Intune's group tag field maps to the OrderID attribute on Microsoft Entra devices. To create a group that includes all Autopilot devices with a specific group tag (the Microsoft Entra device OrderID), enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq "[OrderID]:179887111881")).

To create a group that includes all the Autopilot devices with a specific Purchase Order ID, enter: (device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -eq "[PurchaseOrderId]:76222342342"))

Save the expressions.
###



add the following expression

(device.devicePhysicalIDs -any (_ -startsWith "[ZTDid]")).


save and create the group

now you can go to Devices in the windows deployment
/ Enroll devices / Deployment Profiles

Create profile

Windows PC

        Basics

give it a name


note:
convert all target devices to autopilot = if you choose yes it will only make a difference if you reset the devices.
so for me I chose yes

-------------

            OOBE
Deployment mode = there are 2 options User-Devices / Self-Deployment

if you choose user-Driven user will have more options


so choose user-Driven
Join to azure id / entra id Azure AD joined

Privacy settings = Hide
Hide change account options = Hide
User account type = Standard
Allow pre-provisioned deployment = this is for if you want wipe any other apps and stuff but for now choose no

Language = choose what you want
Automatically configure keyboard layout =  Yes
Apply device name template =  Yes


Enter a name

make it like this so that it changes the system name that makes life easier like this (if our company name is LUFFY)

LUFFY-%RAND.5%

which will make the system names LUFFY-a random 5 digit number


-----

        Assignments

Add group
add the group you created before


### there are 2 types included groups and excluded group

excluded group over rides the included group

if a device is in 2 different group it will go to excluded group

-----

Create your profile


make sure autoenrollment is turned on

Device / Enroll devices / Enroll devices / windows enrollment

make sure it is on All for both MDM user scope and MAM user scope



go to azure Active directory

go to company branding

you can customise the default sign in experience if you wanted to make something cool like sign in oage text like  

WELCOME TO OUR COMPANY

or what ever different thing you want

========================================================

Enrollment status page

this for when the device just turned on and connected to the autopilot for the first time you can change different stuff you want, there is a default and it's prety good change if you wanted.

========================================================

Do a sysprep on your windows client machine and you can see what will happen with the whole thing just like if the system was added the first time and adds the machine to autopilot

========================================================

###############################################################################

RBAC = role based access control

roles explanation

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/role-based-access-control


Basically if you go to your panel (portal.azure.com   now it has been changed it might change later again its admin.azure.com)


in the menu button go to azure active directory go to roles and administrators

Global administrator is the strongest user (domain and intune)


there is another one which is very important is Intune Administrator
it's obvious it's for intune service administrator (it's full control for intune not for the domain)



if you go to endpoint.microsoft.com
in the Tenant administration you can check the roles and choose the proper one for each person

---------------

                    Scope tag



Maybe you have different sites and admins and lets say if you have a London office and you want the Lodon's admin to have access to London ones you can do that in scope tags


By default they have it for everywhere so create a scope tag in 

Tenant admin / roles / endpoint manager roles / scope tag

name = write the name of the location like London 
Next

assignments you can add the proper group that you have in azure AD

the group is in Groups / new group 

it can be security or microsoft 365 because it's for users it can be any

security
Group name = London admins

add the proper users 

now in the scope tag you can add the group

save the thing


now if you go to all roles

create your own role

name it London admins
choose the roles you want like compliance, device config, device enrollment manager, endpoint analytic, ...

in the next step after permission remove the Default and add the London

create the thing


now you have the role go to the role and assign it
Name London admins assignment

then add the admin group (London admins)

scope groups now choose the security group that you created for London devices

you can choose all devices in scope groups and choose London in the Scope tags

now go to devices / windows / choose your desired device

in the properties scope tags is on Default, so just add it to London group or just remove the Default

========================================================

        ENROLLMENT TO AZURE AD (ENTRA ID)


here is the link for it

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment



go to portal.azure.com

go to azure active directory

in all devices you can see every system


if you wanted to manually add a system to azure AD (not with autopilot)

settings / accounts / access work or school

connect and authenticate with your credentials


be default if you add a system to just intune and not to azure ad

use Enroll only in device management

if you just wanted to join the system to azure AD and not to intune you can do that too


REMINDER
if you want that every system you add to intune joins the system to add to azure AD in the 

azure active directory in the mobility you can add what MDM product you are using but here we are using Intune click on it and make sure that it is on all so that every system get's joined to our domain


if we want a user that is joined to our AD and we want it to joint to intune
we can do that too
in endpoint.microsoft.com 
in devices / enroll devices / automatic devices

make sure it's on all for MDM and MAM

if the user has license for intune, you can check in the users open your user and you can see if you have the license


####
cool command to see the Azure AD status
dsregcmd /status

but sometimes it takes a long time until it tell it sometime it's joined this command show it after ours


========================================================

gpo for auto enrollement group policy on a single pc


https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/how-to-hybrid-join



gpedit.msc

local computer / Administrative / windows components / MDM 
enable automatic ...

for domain first login in azure ad connect
config hyber azure ad
device systems check the windows 10 and later
scp config 

check the forest and choose authentication service with azure AD add it will ask for admin user pass 

next wait then configure

now go to gpmc.msc create a new policy called AutoEnrollment

Computer / Administrative / windows components / MDM 
enable automatic ...

user credential


save and assign it to the ou that you want


REMINDER 
MAKE SURE Microsoft Azure AD Sync is running othee wise it won't sync to the Azure AD

to manually sync our dc with our Azure AD

Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta





soooo
we have a system that is joined to our domain but not our azure AD


first find the user in azure AD and make sure it has the license
(it's user in our AD so first creat the user sync it to Azure AD)


you can do that in portal.azure.com
azure ad / licensess / all products 
Enterprise mobility + security E5

add the user here
select and assign it here



now if you go to the client system that is joined to domain and not the Azure AD just login with that user on that system


there is another way that you can install intune company portall from microsoft store install the app and put your credentials and if you have the license it will work


here is the link for these stuff

========================================================


Intune connector for active directory


https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/autopilot/windows-autopilot-hybrid


go to intune admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

in the devices / enroll devices / windows enrollment / intune connector for AD

download the on premise intune connector for AD


go on the DC
create a ou name it something like
Autopilot Domain Join
Delegate control for it
remember to add computers in object types
add our DC

next
only the following
check computer objects
check create selected objects in this folder
check delete selected objects in this folder

next

permissions scheck them all

next

Turn of IE enhanced security config in the server manager Local server and turn it off


install the intune connector and login to your account

========================================================

Managing Local groups membership with intune for windows devices


like doing restricted group in group policy

go to intune admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

Endpoint security / Account protection

create policy
windows 10 and later
profile local group membership

create

        Basics

Name : London admins or whatever

        Configuration settings
add
administrators or whatever group you want
Add(update)
user selection go with user/groups

and select the user you want

you can use scope tags if you have different sites and places you want like mrA be admin for London add London scope here (Scope tags note have been writen before)

            assignments
add the groups you want or all users and all devices

next and create


to force sync group policy on a device

go to devices / windows / windows devices and sync the device there but it's windows maybe you need to restart the system

========================================================

Remote help in intune

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/remote-help



depends on the license you have the license should have the remote help Add-on 

Intune suite and standlone add-on has it

if you dont have it if you go to microsoft 365 admin center (portal.microsoft.com)
in the billing purchase services search remote help add on

buy the thing now you can use it

create a user in users active users 
name the user and everything

next

assign the license to the user

next and fininsh


go back to licenses and assign it to your admin users

In the Microsoft intune admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

in the tenant administration / remote help / settings

enable it

allow remote help to unenrolled devices and disable chat no



now go to groups create a group
security group
remote help operators

assign the members

and create


in the tenant administration in roles
all roles / help desk operator (the user) open it 

in assignments
assign
name it help operators for remote help permissions

admin groups
add the groups and user that you want

scope groups and scope tags as needed next and finish

download the remote help app from the link above

install the app
open the app (remote help)

sign in to your account

now on your client side you have to install the same app
login with their account

and use code to connect to the other system from admin side
click on full control
the person who needs help has to allow it

and it works just like anydesk you don't need to open any port or anything


it can be used without the user

you can go to intune admin cernter (endpoint.microsoft.com)
devices/ windows / windows devices / choose your device and in the ... you have a new remote assistance session and you can use that to connect to client system

========================================================

Compliance policies in intune

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started


in the intune admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

Groups / all groups create a group or choose the group you want

add the users and computers that you want

for example let's make sure all the devices and users that are in this group, must have their firewall on


go to Devices / compliance policies

Create policy select your platform (windows 10 or later)
name it something like London devices firewall compliance
next

if you have a script you can use it here too but we dont want that now but this is how you do it

custom compliance Required
select your discovery script

or just open the links and choose what you want here we want to make sure firewall is on 

Device health turn on what you want like minimum and maximum os other stuff choose what you want and make it required

password part is very important

in the device security make firewall required
use it to force other stuff too like anivirus and other stuff


next

Actions for non compliance

you can choose that an email be sent to the user or
Add device to retire which means if they have their firewall off intune will stop giving service to it you can use it if the firewall was off for 2 days then do it depends on you

next 
scope tags again depends on what you want

assignments
add the group that you want and create

========================================================

Conditional Access policies in intune


MAKE SURE YOU DON'T LOCK YOURSELF OUT


Creating conditional access policy
it can be done drom almost every where

portal.azure.com in entra ID / security / conditional access
entra.microsoft.com in protection / conditional access
intune.microsoft.com in devices / conditional access


Give it a name 
assign it to whoever you want make sure if you choose all users you exclude yourself

target resources depends on what you want with cloud apps you can choose microsoft cloud stuff like office 365, windows 365, ... 

conditions this means when the policy should apply like if there is a sign in risk apply the policy


grant do you want to block or grant it, block is obvious, grant is good for implementing stuff like mfa or authentication strenght, require pass change, which apps are approved, ...

make sure you choose the all the requirements

session this controls different sessions but it only works with supported apps in microsoft, ...


in the end there are 3 options on off and read only choose what you need.


ALWAYS ADD AT LEAST THESE

ACTIVEE FIREWALL REQUIRED
ANTISPYWARER EQUIRED
ANTIVIRUS REQUIRED

all in device security part

========================================================

Managing the notifications for compliance

in endpoint.microsoft.com

Devices / compliance policies / notifications

create one
name it
choose your email options

choose your language and message

choose your scope tage

and create

now go here Devices / compliance policies / policies

choose your policy
go to properties, actions  for noncomplience

choose the send email to end user choose your time and in the message template you can choose the one your wrote before in this part save and done :D

========================================================

Monitoring compliance


endpoint.microsoft.com

in the first page it shows how many machines are not compliant

choose the machine go to device compliace and see what's going on

you can check it in the Devices / compliance policies / policies / name of the policy / user status or device status too

you can check it in reports / device compliance too but it takes a while to update here you can gererate the report and export it if you want.

========================================================

compliance troubleshooting

now we know that a machine is not compliant

in the endpoint.microsoft.com
Devices / windows (for example) / you can see which machine is not compliant choose the device see why the machine is not compliant

it will take a little while after we fix the issue to make it faster that it knows to allow the user to access stuff

go to device / windows / choose the device and sync
but it will still take a while :D


if you wanted to delete a policy
endpoint.microsoft.com

Devices / compliance access / policies
Devices / conditional access / policies
delete the policy in these 2 places

========================================================

Microsoft Intune Admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

Windows enrollment we saw how it was before easiest is to turn it on when a system joins the domain gets enrolled

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment


you can have windows hello for business its for mfa

Cname validation if you have a premium version of AD you wont need it, you only need it if you have a on premis DNS server, and you have to change it for the server, it's because in our on premis when the system is on and the system goes to check the domain name DNS server will show the DC and it can't find the intune in the cloud that's why you should write the name of the domain and check if it working or not in the internet.

you can check the enrollment status there
autopilot we saw before


now let's go for the other supported OS in intune
-------------------------------------
Apple enrollment

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/apple-mdm-push-certificate-get


first you have to have Apple MDM push certificate
you have to agree with them then download your csr then log on the apple website (with your apple id) create a push certificate, upload your file login again and download the request


upload the certificate you downloaded from apple (devices / enroll devices / apple devices)

now apple devices can be enrolled in intune too

-------------------------------------
For Android enrollment

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android

in the admin center

Manage google play / agree / and login to your google account
it will ask for your domain name next
fill in the name and email and stuff
and complete the registration

now your android devices can be enrolled


-------------------------------------
Enrollment device limit registration

Default restriction in on 5
you can change the restriction its prety easy
name it give how many number you want choose your scope and assignments and create

-------------------------------------
Enrollement device platform restrictions

you can have resctrictions on android windows mac ios maybe they add new stuff later


you can edit the default and like block a device or give it a min or max of that os

you can block personal devices here too it's in the next part

-------------------------------------
Corporate device identifiers 


basically you add the IMEI or serial numbers so only these devices can get enrolled

-------------------------------------
Device enrollment managers

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/device-enrollment-manager-enroll


you can add admins here so that, this person can enroll other devices for them, WITH THEIR OWN CREDENTIALS the admin is not gonna ask the user what their credentials is

IT ONLY ALLOWS YOU TOO ADD 1000 DEVICES up to now it cant be changed

========================================================

Manual enrollment


Windows enrollment

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-windows

settings / Accounts / access work or school

if it is on all on windows enrolment in intune admin center, if you have hybrid network you have to turn it on in group policy for the users

or download the intune company portal from microsoft store and login there

-------------------------------------
IOS device

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-ios-ipados

install intune company portal app
login
download the management profile (it's a certificate)
so you do have to the ios settings and install the Management profile in VPN settings

-------------------------------------
Android device

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-android

same as ios
-------------------------------------
Mac device


https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-macos


-------------------------------------
Linux enrollment

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/deployment-guide-enrollment-linux


========================================================

Bulk enrollment to intune

Windows

like how we saw before automatic enrollment should be on all

if you have a hybrid joined device you have to use group policy

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/enroll-a-windows-10-device-automatically-using-group-policy


the policy is here

Computer config / policies / administrative template / windows component / MDM / Enable automatic MDM ...


for the machines that are not part of the domain (not on premis not joined)

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-bulk-enroll

install the windows configuration designer app from store

open the app
provision desktop device
name it

set  up device
you can change the device name, product key,...
network give your ssid and pass for wifi,
account management you can enroll in AD or Azure AD (Entra ID it's all the same)

you can create a local admin on the device here

add applications you can use this for it
add certifications same

in the end give it a pass so that it be encrypted

so just go to the file that you saved copy the file on a usb or something and run the provisioning package

(The file that says AutoEnrollmentProvisioning)

by the way you can do all of these in autopilot as well but this is just another way of doing it


-------------------------------------
Apple devices

in the intune admin center / devices / enroll devices/ apple enrollment / apple configurator / devices

just add their IMEI here or import csv file if you have

profile / create 
give it a name
user affinity there are 2 options

enroll with user affinity is for when company bought the devices (corporate device) and only one user is gonna use it (the device is gonna be linked to the user)

enroll without user affinity is for when device is for shared devices

you can select how they must authenticate
company portal is when they install the app

setup assistance is for devices that are new and we added the serial and they can do it with the wizard


Enrollement program tokens

add and download your public key
create the token
fill the application,...

it's mostly for schools

-------------------------------------
Android

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/android-dedicated-devices-fully-managed-enroll


there is a zreo touch thing 

there is one for personal owned
one for company owned

different options not complicated at all



========================================================


Policies in Intune

this is best used for each offices

the idea is to just grouping bunch of objects together



like if we have a London office

go to endpoint.microsoft.com
devices / policy sets / create

name it like London policy set
you can install the apps that are available, or protection policies and stuff

device management configuration profiles and stuff

you can add a autopilot enrollment profile

use the tag for them

assignment use the group for the London office 

create

========================================================

Using intune to delete, restart, sync, retire or wipe devices


Devices / windows / windows devices 
choose your device
you the options on top

retire means we keep the info but we are not gonna use it again
it will not delete is not gonna delete any personal stuff just the company stuff



delete is for devices that we don't want it to be in intune, 
its like retire but the info is gonna be deleted in tune too.

the wipe will wipe the device clean.

========================================================

IF THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN DOMAIN GPO AND INTUNE POLICY
DOMAIN GPO WILL WIN



IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT POLICIES IN INTUNE THAT THEY CONFLICT


COMPLIANCE ARE GONNA WIN OVER CONFIGURATION PROFILE





Creating a device configuration profile

Intune admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

Devices / configuration profiles

create
you can see the platforms you can make profile for

let's go with windows for now

profile type -> template or settings catalog

template for now 

for windows this is where you can push group policy and different stuff

turn things on or off

you can control updates

domain join

email management
endpoint management
certificate settings

vpn , wifi , ....


Device restrictions 
is the one we do now


name it like London device config

lots of setting categories here you can turn on or off different stuff

like app settings, cellular and bluetooth, cloud printer, display,

lots of different stuff


for the pass policy if the device is joined to the domain it will follow that
and not this


turn antivirus on


choose your scope tag
choose your groups

in the availability rule you can choose assign it if the os version was
a specific version

create




now lets try the settings catalog

this is when everything is here and you can choose whatever you want

again for windows

add the settings this is alot bigger and you can do the same but more options


again its like GPO so choose whatever you want.


assign it to scope and groups and create


========================================================

Troubleshooting and monitoring configuration profile




Devices / configuration profile / choose your profile 


you can see if there is any problem there and get reports there


MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LICESE

in the troubleshooting + support in the troubleshoot part

choose your user and check it there


========================================================

Windows Kiosk mode with intune

First create a group

security group ofcourse

and the devices you want

go to devices / configuration profile

create select windows 10 or later
template
choose kiosk

name it 
select kiosk mode (signle app or multi app)


you can choose a local user and make it auto login
(you have to create the local user yourself)

choose whatever you want like browser and cookies and stuff

scope tags as usual
assignment choose the kiosk group you created

OS version and other stuff too

create

========================================================

Android and ios

device / configuration profile

create 
name it
choose android
device restrictions

choose the stuff you want and done


ios same


========================================================

Configuration policy for health devices and health monitoring






Intune admin center

Devices / configuration profiles

create a new profile

windows 10 and later 
template

choose windows health monitoring

name it
health monitoring enable
scope windows update and analytic data

sope tag 
assignment choose the devices group you want

create

it will take a long time for this to really work it always takes like a day

you can see the results in Reports / Endpoint analytics

##################################################

Intune admin center

in devices we have 3 options 

update rings 
feature update
quality update 


let's start with update rings 

create different groups and use those groups for scheduling


so let's go to groups
create new groups

type = security
name it like preview update ring

we are using this for our production line so this is the most updated version

type = security
name it like Limited update ring

less updates we want them to be more stable

another group
type = security
name it like Broad update ring most stable


go to devices update rings for windows 10 and later 

create a profile
name it something like preview ring

answer as you need

stuff like microsoft profuct update, driver update, feature update, 
upgrade win10 to win11

set feature update uninstall period = 60
active hours of update 

automatic behaviour

answer as you want there

scope tag as usual

assignment now we use the preview group we created



create another profile in update rings

as you want for limited ones like no driver updates
or 5 days grace period or time period from 1am to 6am

scope tag as usual

assignment now we use the limited group we created




another profile for Broad ring

again same thing whatever you want as you need.

save.


-------------

let's do feature update now



create your profile and name it like whatever you want

choose your os

choose your rollout option 
stuff like make available as soon as possible
or specific date or what ever you want and assign it to whatever group you want

--------------

same for quality update

========================================================

Android updates




https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/device-restrictions-android-for-work


Devices / Configuration profiles 

create a profile select android Enterprise
profile type = device restriction

give it a name 

in general you have system update

choose as you need

Defender for endpoint onboarding




First check if you have the proper license

in microsoft 365 admin center

search for endpoint you can see them 

check these links and see all the plans and stuff

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint


you can see all the licensing requirements


https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements


after you bought the thing check it in the license part and assign it 
to your user

it can take a while until it actually works it can be up to 3 hours and maybe more



go to intune admin center (endpoint.microsoft.com)

in endpoint security 

Microsoft defender for endpoint

configuring microsoft defender security center 
open the link (security.microsoft.com)


this is the part that might take 3 hours


in advanced features 
turrn on Microsoft Intune connection and save it


go back to endpoint.microsoft.com

go to endpointsecurity


in the Microsoft defender for endpoint

now you can use it

turn on the important stuff

like allow defender to enforce the config

compliance evaluation turn it on for windows 

you can use the app protection here but that's the next part

save it

now we are ready to send out onboard detection

go to endpoint detection and response 

create policy 
win 10 and later

name it

Microsoft defender for endpoint client config package type = auto from connector

sample sharing = not config

depricated (telemetry reporting) = not config

scope, assign, and create
